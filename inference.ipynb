      "    SOURCE: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama recently shared sensitive intelligence with Russia and China about Iran's newly unveiled nuclear facility to get the two countries' leaders on board with new sanctions against Tehran, senior U.S. officials revealed Friday. President Obama speaks with Chinese President Hu Jintao, left, at the Group of 20 plenary session Friday. And the strategy to build a coalition with Russia and China \"has already begun to bear fruit,\" one senior U.S. official said. The officials declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations. Like the United States, Russia and China are both veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council. Both countries have long opposed additional sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program, although Russian leaders recently have said they might be willing to compromise.  Watch Obama discuss the recent news Â» . Iran admitted to the existence of a second uranium enrichment plant in a letter sent to the International Atomic Energy Agency on Monday, the IAEA said Friday. The announcement prompted Obama, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- all in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the Group of 20 economic summit -- to hold a news conference in which they threatened a stiff response if Iran fails to conform to international obligations regarding nuclear development. \"Iran is breaking rules that all nations must follow,\" Obama said. He called on the Iranian government to \"take concrete steps\" to demonstrate it will comply with its international guidelines to ensure its nuclear program is for civilian use and not a covert weapons program.\n",

      "    SOURCE: (CNN) -- Mexican authorities searching a man with a bulge under his shirt at the airport in the nation's capital found 18 monkeys hidden beneath his clothes, police said. Investigators grew suspicious after Roberto Sol Cabrera Zavaleta, 38, became \"markedly nervous\" when asked what he was transporting, Mexico's Public Safety Department said. Two of the tiny titi monkeys he was carrying in a belt were dead, the department said in a statement, and 16 of them survived the journey from Lima, Peru. Cabrera has been detained as authorities continue their investigation, the statement said. In an interview with authorities released by police, Cabrera said he first carried the monkeys in his suitcase, but then hid the animals in his clothes so they would not be harmed by X-ray machines at the airport. Cabrera described the animals as \"pets\" and told authorities he had purchased them for $30. Titi monkeys are protected endangered species requiring a permit for possession, police said. Images released by police show the tiny creatures, many of which are tied up in pouches, squirming in a cardboard box.\n",

      "    SOURCE: New York (CNN) -- Former pro basketball star Jayson Williams was sentenced to an additional year in prison Friday after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office. Williams had a blood-alcohol level of more than twice the legal limit when he crashed his Mercedes into a tree in lower Manhattan in January -- just a week before he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for accidentally shooting and killing a limousine driver in New Jersey, the district attorney's office told CNN. The year will be added on to the current five-year prison sentence the former NBA player is serving in state prison in New Jersey. He also was also slapped with a $16,433 fine to repair the tree he hit. Williams had been sentenced to five years in prison after fatally shooting his limo driver, Costas \"Gus\" Christofi, in February 2002 at his New Jersey estate. Christofi had been hired to drive the former athlete and several of his friends to dinner after a sporting event in Pennsylvania. The group, including four members of the Harlem Globetrotters, later went back to Williams' home. The prosecution argued that Williams was recklessly handling a 12-gauge shotgun when it discharged and that he and two others tried to make it look as if Christofi had shot himself. Williams, who retired from the NBA in 1999 because of a leg injury, played nine seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Nets.\n",

      "    SOURCE: Washington (CNN) -- A top military official at Walter Reed Army Medical Center has been relieved of duty and charged with knowingly falsifying his personnel records. Command Sgt. Maj. Stoney Crump, the senior enlisted officer for the Medical Center Brigade, had the \"intent to deceive\" when he submitted a false official record incorrectly stating that he had attended several military educational courses, according to the Army charge sheet. Among the courses he is alleged to have attended were Reconnaissance School, Sniper School,; Drill Sergeant Course,; U.S. Army Ranger School and several Special Forces schools and courses, the Army charge sheet says. Crump is also charged with falsely stating in a biography he was a registered nurse. Other charges say he knowingly wore up to fifteen service ribbons and awards he was not entitled to wear, including a Marine Corps Combat Action ribbon and a Presidential Unit Citation, which is awarded for an extremely meritorious or heroic act, usually in the face of an armed enemy. In 13 separate counts, Crump is charged under two different sections of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This opens the door to a possible court martial proceeding. The alleged falsification of his records and biography date back to 2007 when Crump was stationed in Germany and has continued until April of this year, according to the charge sheet. As the top enlisted soldier assigned to the Walter Reed medical brigade, Crump would have had continuous contact with wounded troops at the hospital who have won numerous medals and awards in the combat zone.\n",

      "    SOURCE: (CNN)  -- A Jersey City, New Jersey, police officer shot in the line of duty last week died of his injuries Tuesday, a day before his 38th birthday, a spokeswoman for the city's mayor announced. Police officers gather at the site of a shootout in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Thursday. Jennifer Morrill said Officer Marc DiNardo, who was wounded last Thursday in a shootout, passed away Tuesday morning. Jersey City Police Chief Thomas Comey told reporters Monday night that DiNardo was not expected to live. DiNardo was one of five officers injured early Thursday as they moved in for a tactical entry into an apartment where a shooting suspect and another person were holed up. Officials say the officers were met with gunfire, and a shootout ensued. Both suspects were killed, and DiNardo suffered two gunshot wounds to the face. Melissa Bartholomew, a family friend and fellow police officer, read a statement Monday from DiNardo's family, which includes his wife Mary, three young children and his parents. She said DiNardo, whose 38th birthday is Wednesday, had a personality that no one could forget. \"Marc was not a selfish man. He was a moral man; a man who gave himself for those who couldn't care for themselves,\" she said. DiNardo's family plans to donate his organs, said Joe Scott, president of LibertyHealth and its Jersey City Medical Center. \"This unselfish act will live on in the lives that Marc will impact through organ donation.\" Officer Michael Camacho, who was also wounded in the shootout, was upgraded from critical to serious condition and moved out of the intensive care unit, Scott said Monday. Camacho was shot in the neck during the gun battle. The other three officers were treated at a hospital and released.\n",

Curtis Daniel Miller of Palacios, Texas, was one of 14 men whose plane was shot down on March 29, 1972. Miller and his crew were flying over southern Laos when a missile struck their plane, the Defense Department said Tuesday.

DNA tests have confirmed that they belong to Miller and the other missing crew members. Miller will be buried with full military honors at the Dallas-Ft. Worth National Cemetery on March 29.\n",
