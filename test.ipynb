Patients who underwent the treatment exhibited significant improvement in their symptoms, with some experiencing complete remission. GeneCure works by introducing a harmless virus carrying the corrected genetic material into the patient's cells, addressing the root cause of the disorder at the molecular level. The therapy's success has generated excitement within the medical community, offering hope for those suffering from similar genetic conditions.
